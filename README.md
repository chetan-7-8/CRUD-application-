# CRUD-application-
This web application is developed using Nodejs, ExpressJS, ejs ,and MongoDB.
This is a crud application of grocery store, Where you can perform crud operations.
C=create , R=read , U=update , D=delete.
I have used mongodb as a database here.

Before starting the server do install all the dependencies using the command (npm i).I have not uploded the node modules here.
